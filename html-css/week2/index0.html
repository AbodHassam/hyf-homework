            <h2>ONE PIECE</h2>
            <p>
                One Piece (Japanese: ワンピース Hepburn: Wan Pīsu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
                Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since July 22, 1997, and
                has been collected into 90 tankōbon volumes. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
                whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of
                pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate
                treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next Pirate King.
            </p>
            <p>
                The manga has been adapted into an original video animation (OVA) produced by Production I.G in 1998,
                and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999.
                Additionally, Toei has developed thirteen animated feature films, one OVA and eleven television
                specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising such as a trading card game
                and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North
                America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series
                was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before
                the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.

                One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. Several volumes
                of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in
                Japan. The official website for Eiichiro Oda's One Piece manga announced that the manga has set a
                Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single
                author". As of May 2018, the manga has sold over 440 million copies worldwide, making it the
                best-selling manga series in history. It became the best-selling manga for the tenth consecutive year
                in 2017.

            <h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>
                When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he strove for a "manliness" similar to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon
                Ball series. Oda said that he named his main character "Luffy" because he felt that the name suited
                him. When he later learned about the sailing term, "luffing", he was delighted by the coincidence. In
                his prototype one-shots, "Romance Dawn", Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before
                publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of One Piece. In the second version of
                "Romance Dawn", Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series. To please his readers, Oda
                added rubberization to Luffy for comic effect and tries to make the character straightforward.
